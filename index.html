    <img src="1.png" alt="" style="width:400px;height:200px;">
    <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
    <p>Considering disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Universities, Schools, Colleges, and academic institutions came to standstill. 
      This industry requires rethinking on how to learn and impart education in remote mode. 
      Learn from anywhere and teaching from anywhere is beyond using video conferencing tools because learning is a complex process. 
      My project reflects my study, ideas, and opinions on how the education industry is going to transform in the coming years.
